No ORM of any kind may be introduced into the codebase under any circumstances.

All database access must be implemented using explicit, hand-written SQL statements.

No library may automatically generate SQL queries, map structs via reflection, or manage schema definitions on behalf of the application.

The PostgreSQL schema is the source of truth, and application code must adapt to it rather than redefining it through struct tags or ORM metadata.

All migrations must be written as raw SQL and must not be generated by ORM tooling.
