# Agent Workflows

Workflows define standard operating procedures (SOPs) that the AI agent can automatically follow or reference during tasks.

## Format
Create `.md` files in this directory with the following structure:

```yaml
---
description: [short title, e.g. how to deploy the application]
---
```

Follow the frontmatter with specific, step-by-step markdown instructions.
