The real question is not “which tax is important?”
It’s: **which statutory layers affect your core data model and posting engine?**

Those must be designed from day one.
The rest can sit on top later.

Let’s separate this cleanly.

---

## Add From the Beginning (Foundational)

These affect schema design, document structure, and posting logic. If you bolt them on later, it will hurt.

### 1) Generic Tax Engine (Not “GST”, but tax architecture)

Even if you don’t fully implement GST logic on day one, you must support:

* Tax per line item
* Multiple tax components per line (CGST/SGST style split)
* Input vs Output tax ledgers
* Tax jurisdiction tagging
* Tax rate master table
* Tax ledger posting separation

If your invoice table doesn’t support tax components properly, redesign later will be painful.

So from day one:

Build a **generic tax abstraction layer**, not “GST-specific logic”.

That future-proofs you for:

* GST
* VAT (UAE)
* Sales tax
* Any indirect tax system

This is mandatory early.

---

### 2) TDS / Withholding Architecture (Basic Hook)

You don’t need full section-based logic on day one.

But your payment system must allow:

* Deduction at payment time
* Split between payable to vendor and payable to government
* Tracking cumulative amount per vendor (for threshold logic later)

If your payment voucher assumes:
“Payable = invoice amount”
You’ll regret it.

So design payment posting to allow deductions.

Full TDS logic can come later.
But deduction capability must exist from the start.

---

### 3) Audit Trail + Period Locking

Statutory compliance depends heavily on:

* No editing posted documents
* Reversal entries instead of mutation
* Period close control

If you ignore this early, statutory reporting later becomes unreliable.

This is non-negotiable.

---

## Can Be Added Later (Low Structural Impact)

These are mostly reporting and rule-layer additions.

### 4) TCS

Structurally similar to TDS.
If your withholding model exists, adding TCS later is easy.

---

### 5) E-invoicing Integration

This is:

* API integration
* JSON generation
* IRN storage

It does not change core ledger architecture.
Can be safely added later.

---

### 6) E-way Bill

Operational compliance layer.
Doesn’t affect accounting core.
Can be added later.

---

### 7) Advanced GST Reporting (GSTR-1 automation etc.)

If your tax ledger and invoice data are clean,
report generation is just query logic.

Can be added later.

---

### 8) Payroll Statutory (PF/ESI/PT)

Completely separate module.
Add only if you enter payroll domain.

---

## The Practical Priority Order

If you’re building an SMB accounting + inventory backend:

Day One:

* Double entry engine
* Generic tax component model
* Tax ledger separation
* Withholding hook in payments
* Period locking
* Immutable posting

Phase Two:

* Full GST logic
* TDS rule engine
* Return report generation

Phase Three:

* E-invoice
* E-way bill
* TCS
* Multi-country VAT support

---

## Brutal Truth

If you build:

* Clean posting engine
* Flexible tax component table
* Decoupled tax calculation from journal posting
* Deduction-aware payment model

Then 80% of statutory layers become configuration.

If you hardcode:

* Single tax column in invoice
* Fixed “tax_amount” fields
* Direct payable settlement without deduction abstraction

You’ll fight your own system later.
